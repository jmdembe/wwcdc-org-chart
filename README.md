# Women Who Code DC Org Chart

This is an attempt to display the organizational structure of the DC Network of Women Who Code. It's currently hosted on my site ([katherine.tech](http://www.katherine.tech/wwcdc-org-chart/)) via gh-pages, but that might (hopefully will) change in the future.

## Future Work
* Move the roster to an external source (like a Google Sheet) that can be updated by any director
* Align the text better with the arcs so you can actually read people's names and positions
* Add the capability for names of Directors to go with/below the name of the team or area they direct

## Pull Requests

PRs are happily accepted, especially if they address any of the above issues.
